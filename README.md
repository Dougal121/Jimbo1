Code for the Jim's Lazy Susan (maybe it should be a busy Jim?) kinetic sculpture

I think all the libaries are standard load from the IDE ones.

Now the contents of the microSD card is not listed 
It cantained Jims custom cut stuff but the files where named

001.mp3
002.mp3
003.mp3
etc

They where all placed in the root of the card... we had to add a couple extra as out MP3 player seemed not to play the last track unless we did - never did work that out ?

As always happy coding
